## dungeon_06

### Purpose

- Shows an example shooting sprite that "aims" (somewhat) at another sprite. 
- Good way to add "AI" enemy to shoot at the player (could be better).
- For player shooting at NPC's we could use mouse click, and shoot to pointer location.

- This code adds on to `dungeon_03`
- Files added to:
    - preload:
        - added fire_ball atlas
    - level_01: 
        - Added fire weapon function
