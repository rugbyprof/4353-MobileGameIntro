## Program 3

- Your game should be vaguely similar to what I demoed in class. 
- It can be a vertical or a side scroller.
- It must generate obstacles that move toward the player originating from random locations just off screen. 
- It should not act like the original game that generates two obstacles for the player to "fly" through.
- Obstacles should be randomly chosen from a list of differing obstacle types.
- **Do not use any of the sprites that I have uploaded in my latest version.**
- Your implementation of the checklist below should be different from my example code.  
- For those of you who use all your own code ... good job.
